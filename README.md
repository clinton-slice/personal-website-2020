This projects contains really nice css animation and shows outstanding react skills. The website was built using gatsby

The idea and motivation to build this was based on [Thiago Loschi's](https://github.com/thiagoloschi) version of the website. Check his repo here [personal website 2019](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/personal-website-2019)

### Build your own version

I wanted to build something reuseable. By changing the [config](https://github.com/clinton-slice/personal-website-2020/blob/develop/src/config.json) file, you can adapt the template to your own experiences and within some minutes, build your own personal website.

To develop your own website, clone the project and follow these [instructions to set up your own github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), then read [gatsby docs on starting the project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start). Note that if you're cloning an existing project, you can jump to [starting the development server](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start#start-development-server), after [installing the dependencies](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start#install-gatsbys-command-line-tool). Once you're done with editting the config file, follow this article on how to easily [deploy your website to github pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/). You should then be ready to go!
